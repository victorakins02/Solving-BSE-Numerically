# Solving the Black-Scholes Equation Numerically

## Project Overview
This project numerically solves the **Black-Scholes Equation**, which is widely used in financial mathematics for pricing options, and compares it with the **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)** from quantum mechanics. By using the **Crank-Nicolson Method**, the project solves both equations, highlighting their mathematical similarities and providing accurate results for option pricing and quantum wave function evolution.

## Features
- Implements **C++** code for numerical solutions using the **Crank-Nicolson Method**.
- Compares numerical results with analytical solutions for accuracy verification.
- Supports both **explicit** and **implicit** methods for solving the Black-Scholes and Schrödinger equations.
- **Python** is used to plot the results from CSV files generated by the C++ implementation.
- Efficient matrix-based approach to minimize computational costs.

## Key Methods
1. **Crank-Nicolson Method**: A stable and accurate finite-difference approach used to solve the Black-Scholes and Schrödinger equations.
2. **LU Decomposition**: Solves tridiagonal systems in Crank-Nicolson I.
3. **Thomas Algorithm**: Used in Crank-Nicolson II to optimize performance by eliminating matrix-vector operations.

## Dependencies
- **Eigen** Library: For matrix and vector operations.
- **C++11** or later.
- **Python**: To generate plots from the CSV files. The plotting script uses **matplotlib**.

## Usage

### C++ Code
To run the project, compile and execute the C++ code. Ensure that the **Eigen library** is properly installed and linked.

## Files

- **main.cpp**: The main C++ implementation for solving the equations using Crank-Nicolson methods.
- **data/**: Contains the CSV files with numerical and analytical solutions.
- **plot_results.py**: A Python script to plot results from the CSV files using `matplotlib`.
